# CodeRabbit Code Review

Run an AI-powered code review using CodeRabbit.

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Git repo: !`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null && echo "Yes" || echo "No"`
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "detached HEAD"`
- Has changes: !`git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null | head -1 | grep -q . && echo "Yes" || echo "No"`

## Instructions

Review code based on: **$ARGUMENTS**

### Prerequisites Check

**Skip these checks if you already verified them earlier in this session.**

Otherwise, run:

```bash
coderabbit --version 2>/dev/null && coderabbit auth status 2>&1 | head -3
```

**If CLI not found**, tell user:
> CodeRabbit CLI is not installed. Install it from the official docs:
>
> <https://www.coderabbit.ai/cli>
>
> Prefer a package manager or a verified binary, then restart your shell and try again.

**If "Not logged in"**, tell user:
> You need to authenticate. Run in your terminal:
>
> ```bash
> coderabbit auth login
> ```
>
> Then try again.

### Run Review

Once prerequisites are met:

```bash
# type defaults to "all"; add --base only when specified
coderabbit review --agent -t "${type:-all}" ${base:+--base "$base"}
```

Where `type` and `base` come from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `all` (default) - All changes
- `committed` - Committed changes only
- `uncommitted` - Uncommitted only

Add `--base <branch>` only when a base branch is specified.

### Present Results

Group findings by severity:

1. **Critical** - Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, crashes
2. **Warning** - Bugs, performance issues, anti-patterns
3. **Info** - Style issues, suggestions, minor improvements

Offer to apply fixes from the `--agent` findings when the output includes actionable remediation details.
